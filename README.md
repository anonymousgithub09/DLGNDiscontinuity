# DLGNDiscontinuity
*1.DLGN_DLGN_SF_Synthetic* -- For running DLGN and DLGN-SF models on synthetic datasets. The best hyperparameters trained on each dataset for DLGN and DLGN-SF are mentioned in the code block as comments.\
*2.DLGN_DLGN_SF_Tabular* -- For running DLGN and DLGN-SF models on Tabular datasets mentioned in the paper.\
*3.ML_Synthetic* -- To run all ML models like Linear and Non-Linear SVM, CART, Random Forest and ReLU Network models on Synthetic datasets on the hyperparameter set and choose the best test accuracy.\
*4.ML_Tabular* -- To run all ML models like Linear and Non-Linear SVM, CART, Random Forest and ReLU Network models on Tabular datasets mentioned in the paper on the hyperparameter set and choose the best test accuracy.\
*5.Tao_Synthetic_Tabular* -- To run the TAO algorithm on the Synthetic dataset, set DATA_NAME="syn" and to run it on the tabular dataset, set DATA_NAME="Tabular". TAO hyperparameters can be adjusted to find the best model.\
*6.SDT_Synthetic* and *7.SDT_Tabular* -- To run the SDT algorithm on the Synthetic and tabular datasets.\
*8.ZanDT_Synthetic_Tabular* -- To run Zan-DT on a Synthetic dataset, use "syn" as an argument, and for tabular datasets, use "UCI".\
*9.Disjunctive_Normal_Networks* -- To run Disnn on Synthetic dataset, use "syn" as an argument, and for tabular datasets, use "UCI".\
*10.Gated Linear Networks* -- We use https://github.com/aiwabdn/pygln.git code for gln on our datasets. To run gln on Synthetic dataset, use "syn" as an argument, and for tabular datasets, use "UCI".\
